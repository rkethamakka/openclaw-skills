## Reading the Resume

**⚠️ ALWAYS read the resume before writing — don't make up projects!**

```bash
python3 -c "from pypdf import PdfReader; r = PdfReader('/Users/ravikiran/Documents/Google-Drive/ravi_jobs/Naga_Ravi_Kiran_Resume_2026.pdf'); print(''.join(p.extract_text() for p in r.pages))"
```

## Style Guide

**Opening:** Start with referral mention if applicable, then state the role.
```
Hi, I'm reaching out upon referral from [Name] to apply for [Position] at [Company]...
```
OR
```
Hi, I'm applying for the [Position] at [Company]...
```

**Body - Key Achievements to Highlight:**

| Project | Year | Key Themes | Numbers |
|---------|------|------------|---------|
| **AI Agents Marketplace** | 2025 | Multi-agent, Claude SDK, A2A protocol | 6 agents, 80% effort reduction, 3 months, 5 engineers |
| **API Gateway Platform** | 2024-25 | Spring Cloud Gateway, UDP model | 20 engineers, 10K+ TPS, 10x scalable |
| **Control Plane** | 2022-24 | Config management, partner onboarding | 75% faster (3mo→10d) |

| **Conversation Platform** | 2018-19 | Kafka, omnichannel | millions msgs/day, 99.9% uptime |

**Match project themes to role requirements (indirectly, don't be obvious)**

**Tone:** Direct, confident, achievement-focused. No fluff. Show impact with numbers.

**Closing:** Express eagerness, tie back to company mission.

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Read the Job Description

Identify key themes:
- What tech stack?
- What scale?
- What problems?
- What team culture?

### Step 2: Pick Relevant Projects

Match job themes → project themes:

| Job Theme | Best Project Match |
|-----------|-------------------|
| AI/ML, Agents | AI Agents Marketplace |
| Infrastructure, Scale | API Gateway Platform |
| Platform, DevEx | Control Plane |
| NLP, Automation | Virtual Agent Platform |
| Messaging, Reliability | Conversation Platform |

### Step 3: Write the Letter

**Structure:**
1. Opening — Role + referral (if any)
2. Relevant experience paragraph (2-3 achievements)
3. Why this company/role
4. Closing

**Length:** 250-400 words

### Step 4: Save

```bash
# Create company folder if needed
mkdir -p "/Users/ravikiran/Documents/Google-Drive/ravi_jobs/[Company]"
```

**Filename:** `[Role_Short_Name]_Cover.docx`

Example: `Staff_GenAI_System_Engineer_Cover.docx`

## Creating the DOCX

```python
from docx import Document

doc = Document()
doc.add_paragraph("Hi,")
doc.add_paragraph("")
doc.add_paragraph("[Opening paragraph]")
doc.add_paragraph("")
doc.add_paragraph("[Body paragraph - achievements]")
doc.add_paragraph("")
doc.add_paragraph("[Why company paragraph]")
doc.add_paragraph("")
doc.add_paragraph("[Closing]")
doc.add_paragraph("")
doc.add_paragraph("Best,")
doc.add_paragraph("Ravi Kethamakka")

doc.save("/Users/ravikiran/Documents/Google-Drive/ravi_jobs/[Company]/[Role]_Cover.docx")
```

## Template
